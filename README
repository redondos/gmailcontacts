The script will look for a pair of credentials to use to log-in in this order:
- Command line arguments: -u|-p,
- environment variables: GMAILUSER|GMAILPASS, or
- given to the script itself interactively.

There's also a '-v' option that shows a bit more of information in case 
there's anything not working.

The output format is in the form "ADDRESS\tFULL NAME", according to mutt's
query_command's requirements.

Important: remember to set the username and password if you're going to use
the script with mutt, since query_command does not let you input any data.

Mutt macros example, with the disadvantage of not being able to choose which one 
to use with <complete-query>:

macro generic Q '<enter-command> set query_command="~/bin/muttquery.py %s"<enter>\
		<query>' 'Query KAddressBook'
macro index ,q '<enter-command> set query_command="~/bin/gmailcontacts.py -u redondos %s"<enter>\
		<query>' 'Query Gmail contacts'

Bugs:
Queries take too much time, maybe the results should be cached.
